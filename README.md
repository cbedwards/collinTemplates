# collinTemplates

This is an R package to use my standard Rmarkdown template (which is subject to updates/tweaks).

Package can be installed using the devtools package

install.packages("devtools");

library("devtools");

install_github('cbedwards/collinTemplates');

Once this package is installed, "Collin's standard rmd" will be available in File > New File > R Markdown > From Template. (Note: this will require a restart of Rstudio after installing the package). While designed as a template to work from, this file can be compiled immediately, which will demonstrate the use of .tabset as well as generating a readme file in the parent directory.
